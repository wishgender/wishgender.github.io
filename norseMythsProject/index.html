        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Overall, it is quite clear that Gaiman's <i>Norse Mythology</i> shares a vast amount of similarities to the original mythology. I would argue that this is to be expected, considering that it is merely intended as a retelling for modern audiences. The Marvel Cinematic Universe incarnations, however, take significantly more creative liberties when portraying these characters, resulting in a situation where the characters may have originally been based on the mythological figures, but have since been molded into entirely new chracters, with differing personalities, motives, and priorities.</p>
